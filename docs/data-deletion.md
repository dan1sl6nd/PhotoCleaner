# Data Deletion Instructions

**Last Updated:** January 6, 2026

## What Data Does PhotoCleaner Collect?

### Your Photos Are Safe

**PhotoCleaner does NOT collect, upload, or store your photos.** All photo analysis happens locally on your device. Your photos never leave your device.

PhotoCleaner may collect the following limited data:
- **App Usage Analytics:** App interactions, events, and feature usage (via Facebook SDK)
- **Device Information:** Device model, OS version, and device identifiers
- **Subscription Data:** Managed entirely by Apple through the App Store

## How to Delete Your Data

### Option 1: Delete All App Data (Recommended)

To completely remove all data associated with PhotoCleaner:

1. **Uninstall the App** from your iOS device
   - Long-press the PhotoCleaner app icon
   - Tap "Remove App"
   - Confirm deletion

2. **All local data is permanently deleted** when you uninstall
   - App preferences and settings
   - Photo analysis cache
   - Any temporary files

### Option 2: Request Analytics Data Deletion

To request deletion of analytics data collected via Facebook SDK:

1. Send an email to dan1sl6nd@gmail.com
2. Include "Data Deletion Request" in the subject line
3. Provide your device identifier (IDFA) if known, or describe when you used the app
4. We will process your request within 30 days

### Option 3: Delete Subscription Data

Subscription data is managed by Apple, not PhotoCleaner:
- **To cancel your subscription:** Go to iOS Settings → Your Name → Subscriptions → PhotoCleaner → Cancel
- **To request deletion of subscription records:** Contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/contact)
- **Note:** Canceling removes future charges but doesn't delete historical records (contact Apple for that)

## What Happens After Deletion?

### Immediate Effects
- All local app data is removed from your device
- You lose access to app features and any app preferences

### Analytics Data

## Re-installing the App

If you re-install PhotoCleaner after deletion:

- Your subscription status (if any) will be restored via Apple
- You'll need to grant photo permissions again
- All photo analysis will run from scratch
